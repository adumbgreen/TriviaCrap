    <string name="faq_r_119">"Spin the wheel to start answering questions! Slide your finger on it or touch the 'Spin' button to start playing. You will get one of the six categories of the game and you'll be able to start answering questions!"</string>
    <string name="faq_r_120">There are six different categories: Entertainment, Geography, History, Art, Science and Sports.</string>
    <string name="faq_r_121">Answer questions correctly to get the character from each category. The first to get all six characters will be the winner of the game!</string>
    <string name="faq_r_122">There are two methods. If you fall in the special slot of the wheel, you get to choose between playing for a character or challenging your opponent to steal one of theirs. You will also have the chance of getting a character every time you answer three questions in a row correctly. You can choose which character to play for!</string>
    <string name="faq_r_123">When you dare your opponents to a challenge you compete against them to steal one of their characters. Both players get the same 6 questions, 1 for each category. The one with the most correct answers wins the challenge.</string>
    <string name="faq_r_124">"Yes! Whenever you fall in the special slot of the wheel you get to choose a character among the ones you still don't have. The same happens with the challenges: among all the characters your opponent has, you can choose which one you'll try to steal."</string>
    <string name="faq_r_125">No. If your opponent challenges you, you will have to defend your characters as bravely as possible.</string>
    <string name="faq_r_126">"Exactly. You lose it, but your opponent doesn't get it."</string>
    <string name="faq_r_127">"No. If your opponent challenges you, you can't reject it. You will have to defend the character they choose!"</string>
    <string name="faq_r_128">"If there's a tie, the user who's been challenged will have to answer another question to break the tie. If the answer's right, he or she will win the challenge, and if it's wrong, he or she will lose."</string>
    <string name="faq_r_129">"Extra spins allow you to spin again when you don't want to answer a question of the category you got. You can spin again once per turn."</string>
    <string name="faq_r_130">When you first install Trivia Crack, you get 3 extra spins. You can get more by asking your friends for free, or you can buy more in our online shop.</string>
    <string name="faq_r_133">"On the game screen, you'll see a button with the Statistics icon on the low right side. Tap on it to see your percentage and number of correct and incorrect answers, as well as those for your opponent, for the current game."</string>
    <string name="faq_r_134">You can use coins to buy PowerUps. When you first install Trivia Crack, you get a starting amount of 20 coins.</string>
    <string name="faq_r_135">"You get coins by winning Trivia Crack matches. The amount of coins you get will depend on your results! If you resign the game, you won't get any even if you answer several questions correctly. You can also buy more coins at the Shop with real money."</string>
